# Introduction

labDAO requires a governance model to support its goal of building a decentralized, contributor-owned and operated platform for enabling scientific experiments and R&D services.

# Membership
Membership in labDAO requires each member to hold a minimum of one (1) $LAB token, which is the governance token of labDAO.
A member is entitled to vote on all proposals which are put before the labDAO membership, and exercise the rights associated with their $LAB tokens as part of the formal voting process, and are encouraged to participate actively and regularly in the governance through labDAO’s [Discord](https://discord.gg/labdao) and [Discourse](https://forum.labdao.com/) (also known as “forum”) platforms.
Governance tokens can be obtained by providing funds or work-in-kind to the structure. Members have full governance rights and can participate in governance on Discord and Discourse (informally) and via token-based voting (formally).

# Working Groups
A working group member provides expertise and advice to labDAO. Working Group members should be able to provide objective advice, and must declare any pecuniary interests when providing that advice.
Just like Working groups membership is not a compensated positop. In cases where working group members are paid (e.g., coordination working group), group members can be compensated in $LAB, stablecoins (such as USDC), or other incentive schemes decided by members on project basis.

## Core

## Inaugural Working Groups

1. Community
2. Coordination
3. Technology

Working Group Stewards

Each working group (WG) will have up to 3 Leads who provide the organizational cohesion for the working group. They will be responsible for on-boarding and off-boarding working group members and may define a specific structure for their respective working group and how they operate, collaborate and get compensated, pending approval by labDAO members. WG Leads are responsible for ensuring members of their WG have the resources, opportunities, and environment to perform at the best of their abilities such that they can best achieve their objectives within the WG. WG Leads are ultimately responsible for ensuring the mandates of the WG are met and will be held accountable to the community.

### Onboarding of a New Steward

A new WG Lead is onboarded through the following process:

1. Any WG Member can nominate anyone as a new WG Lead.
2. Once a new WG Lead is nominated, another WG Lead can challenge the nomination within a week.
3. If the nomination isn’t challenged, members of all working groups vote on the nomination by a poll attached to a Discourse proposal (of the nomination).
4. If a majority of votes is in agreement, the nominated WG Lead is offered the position.
5. If the nominated WG Lead accepts, they are officially onboarded to their new role.

### Offboarding as an Existing Steward

An existing WG Lead is offboarded through one of the following events:

Option A

1. In a vote necessarily recurring every six months, members of all working groups vote on whether the Lead should remain in place in an anonymous poll on Discord or Discourse.
2. If a majority of members of all working groups do not confirm the Lead, the Lead is offboarded.

OR

Option B

1. In a vote optionally occurring at any time, members of all working groups vote on whether the Lead should remain in place in an anonymous poll on Discord or Discourse.
2. If a majority of members of all working groups do not confirm the Lead, the Lead is offboarded.

OR

Option C

1. $LAB token holders vote to offboard the Lead in a phase 3 vote (Discourse + Snapshot).
2. If the Snapshot vote passes, the Lead is offboarded.

OR

Option D

1. Another lead nominates the lead for offboarding.
2. If a member of the WG Leads does not challenge the nomination within a week, the leadis offboarded.

OR

Option E

1. The Lead chooses to offboard themselves and gives notice at least two weeks in advance.
2. After the end of the notice period, the lead is offboarded.

## Service Providers

Service Providers are members who provide services to labDAO, such as development work, IP sourcing, conversion to NFTs, marketplace services, drug development services outside of project scope, etc. Service providers are paid for their services in stable coins, offered tokens in exchange, or a combination thereof. On a case-by-case basis, service providers can also be paid in fiat.

Service Providers serve at the pleasure of the Working Groups and compensation shall be negotiated by the Working Group Leads responsible for each project or activity.

# Governance Framework Overview

* labDAO members are in control of all governance decisions by voting on labDAO proposals. Proposals vary by type and follow the process specified below.
* labDAO members’ votes are weighted by the amount of LAB tokens they own.
* Working group leads upload proposals to Snapshot for formal token-based voting.
* If a token-based vote results in a change of rules, payout of funds or similar administrative functions, that is executed on by a multi-signature wallet (multisig) which is defined in a separate proposal.
* labDAO working groups consist of labDAO members to help guide member decisions in various work streams and organizational processes. Working groups can help define proposals to the labDAO members.
* Working group meetings are scheduled and operated in the open, and the only requirement to join is being a holder of labDAO tokens.
* labDAO may engage service providers spanning patent attorneys, contract research firms, or third party experts to provide services to the DAO in exchange for compensation.

# Proposal Process Overview

1. Phase I: Informal - A post in the labDAO Ideas Category in Discourse , discussion thread on Discord, or as a result of a working group call.
2. Community Support Indicated by Discourse or Discord Vote, or a vote during a working group call.
3. Phase II: Formal - Post on [labDAO Proposal Category](https://forum.labdao.com/c/proposals/6) with Template and Phase II tag
4. Community Support Indicated by Discourse Vote
5. Phase III: Upload to [dao.labDAO.com ](http://dao.labdao.com) for token-based vote.

## Phase 1: Ideation

This phase facilitates an initial, informal discussion consisting of labDAO members on Discord, or in the Ideas area of Discourse regarding potential proposals to labDAO. Members can initiate a proposal in Phase 1 by collaborating on a proposal [draft](https://www.notion.so/Project-Proposal-Template-don-t-move-eae46fd306664273bd5611c91bf0ad60) . This phase allows proposals to gather community insight for refinement before opening a formal poll. Project proposals submitted by externals are automatically generated and posted in the proposal channel on the discourse forum.

### Phase I Duration: Open-ended

### Passing Requirement

For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 1 to Phase 2, at least 10 members must signal positive support. If a Phase 1 proposal discussion fails to garner momentum from the community, it is unlikely to become a successful proposal. If there are less than 5 votes within three days of posting, the proposal is voided.

## Phase 2: Specification

Proposals that receive more than 10 votes are moved to Phase 2. This phase requires proposals to be posted in the [labDAO Proposals category](https://forum.labdao.com/c/proposals/6) on Discourse using the [labDAO Governance Proposal template (LDP) 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sp9Xwm6dg0z8kmMuns8gmdAJgEnAOt1Xukeql_G_MEk/edit?usp=sharing). Beside proper naming, the LDP template requires all proposals to include fields including but not limited to a Simple Summary, Abstract, Motivation (the “problem”), Specification (“the solution”), and Implementation.

Beside proper naming, the LDP template requires all proposals to include fields including but not limited to a Simple Summary, Abstract, Motivation (the “problem”), Specification (“the solution”), and Implementation.

In addition to these fields, Phase 2 proposals must include a single-choice poll on the proposal outcome giving the options “Agree”, “Agree with revisions” (requiring a comment), and “Disagree”. Participation should be restricted to trust level 1 and above and will be increased to trust level 2 at some point (see [Discourse Trust Levels 1](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/)). The poll should result in a pie chart with results visible, as per this template:

```
[poll type=regular results=always public=true chartType=pie groups=trust_level_1]

* Agree
* Agree, with revisions (please comment)
* Disagree

[poll type=regular results=always public=true chartType=pie groups=trust_level_1]

* Agree
* Agree, with revisions (please comment)
* Disagree

[/poll]

[/poll]
```

The proposal author is responsible to incorporate comments from “Agree with revisions” votes. If their comment is fully resolved, commenting authors are supposed to change their vote from "Agree with revisions” to “Agree”.

### Phase 2 Duration: 10 days

### Passing Requirement

For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 2 to Phase 3, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes on a Discourse poll. Proposals in Phase 2 require support from two working group leads, and at least 10 members to vote. If the relative majority of votes on the forum poll indicates the result “Agree” (including any resolved “Agree with revisions” votes), the proposal will pass to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Consensus

Phase 2 proposals are moved to Phase 3 by editing the Phase 2 proposal post from the previous phase to reflect the forum poll result that received a relative majority of votes, and by updating the proposal’s tag to phase-3. Proposals that pass the Phase 2 forum poll must be locked in this forum and referenced on [dao.labDAO.com](http://dao.labdao.com/) to become an on-chain Phase 3 vote.

### Phase 3 Duration: 5 days

### Passing Requirement

Majority vote with 5% quorum of circulating token supply via formal token-based vote.

Soft Governance vs. Token-based Voting

In principle, as many decisions as possible should be made using a soft governance mechanism via Discord or within working groups and teams. As a general rule, on-chain votes are required for high-stakes decisions that fall under one of the following categories:

(a) revolve around the treasury and a certain level of expenses;

(b) revolve around the rules or the rules to change the rules [the constitutional process]; or

(c) revolve around membership and enforcement of norms [punitive measures].

Other decisions should be taken through soft governance.
