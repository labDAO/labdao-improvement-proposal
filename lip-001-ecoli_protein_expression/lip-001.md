## Simple Summary

This laboratory services enables scientist


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the expression of a target protein in E. coli with subsequent purification of the protein. The service provider: 
1. receives an amino acid sequence
2. expresses and purifies a protein given standardized instructions in E.coli
3. returns quality control and sample information


## Motivation

A standard interface for protein expression in E. coli enables computational scientists to submit a request for protein expression programmatically to the lab-exchange. The minted lab-NFT contains information about the quality of the purified sample and confers ownership of the physical sample and the quality control data to the owner of the token.
